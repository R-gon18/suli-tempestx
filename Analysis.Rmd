## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r babynames}
library(babynames)
summary(babynames)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
qplot(speed, dist, data = cars, size = speed)
```

```{r read_metadata}
library(readr)
library(dplyr)
collar_map <- read_csv("collar_map.csv")
print(collar_map)
```

```{r read_data}
# Find all the data files to read and put into 'file' character vector
files <- list.files("data/", pattern = "*.txt", full.names = TRUE)

# Read the first file
dat <- read_tsv(files[1],
                col_names = c("Timestamp", "Obs", "Port",
                              "CO2_Flux", "Collar", "CH4_Flux"), 
                col_types = "_Tdcddd___",
                skip = 1)
```
