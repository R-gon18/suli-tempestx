## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r babynames}
library(babynames)
summary(babynames)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(babynames)
qplot(year, name, data = head(babynames), size = n)
```

```{r}
collar_map <- read.csv("collar_map.csv")
print(collar_map)
```

```{r}
ltc_map <- read.csv("ltc_map.csv")
ltc_map %>% print()
filter(exp_flux != 0)
```
