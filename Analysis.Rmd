## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r babynames}
library(babynames)
summary(babynames)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(babynames)
qplot(year, name, data = head(babynames), size = n)
```

```{r}
collar_map <- read.csv("collar_map.csv")
print(collar_map)
```

```{r}
ltc_map <- read.csv("ltc_map.csv")
ltc_map %>% print()
```

```{r read_data}
# Find all the data files to read and put into 'file' character vector
files <- list.files("data/", pattern = "*.txt", full.names = TRUE)
# Read the first file
library(readr)
dat <- read_tsv(files[1],
                col_names = c("Timestamp", "Obs", "Port",
                              "CO2_Flux", "Collar", "CH4_Flux"), 
                col_types = "_Tdcddd___",
                skip = 1)
```

```{r}
# Make a quick plot
qplot(Timestamp, CO2_Flux, data = dat)
# start here with steps below...    dat %>% ...
dat <- dat %>% filter(CO2_Flux != 0)
dat %>% summary() %>% print()
```

```{r}
collar_map <- collar_map %>% select(Collar, Treatment)
left_join(dat, collar_map) -> by_treatment
by_treatment %>% group_by(Treatment) %>%
  summarise(n = n(), 
            avg_CO2 = mean(CO2_Flux, na.rm = TRUE), 
            avg_CH4 = mean(CH4_Flux))
```
